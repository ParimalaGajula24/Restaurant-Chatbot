**Restaurant Chatbot Project**

**Overview**

This project is an NLP-based chatbot built using Dialog Flow to handle real-time food ordering, order tracking, and user interactions. The chatbot is integrated with a FastAPI backend and utilizes a MySQL database to manage and store user orders. The front-end is a responsive website built with HTML and CSS, offering users an intuitive interface to interact with the chatbot and view the restaurant's menu, location, and contact details.

**Features**

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Chatbot powered by Dialog Flow to handle various user intents such as placing new orders and tracking existing orders.
- **Backend:** FastAPI framework for managing API requests between the chatbot and the database.
- **Database:** MySQL database with stored procedures and functions for efficient order storage and retrieval.
- **Frontend:** Responsive website created using HTML and CSS to display the restaurant menu, location, and contact details.
- **Order Tracking:** Allows users to track their previous orders and place new ones.

**Working**

This chatbot leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), powered by Dialog Flow, to understand and respond to user queries. When a user interacts with the chatbot (e.g., placing a food order, checking order status, or inquiring about the restaurantâ€™s details), Dialog Flow processes the natural language input and maps it to predefined intents such as "New Order" or "Track Order." Based on the detected intent, Dialog Flow triggers a webhook that sends the user's request to a FastAPI backend. The FastAPI backend serves as the logic handler for the chatbot, receiving requests from Dialog Flow and executing the necessary actions. For example, when a user places a new order, the backend processes the order details, interacts with a MySQL database, and stores the order information using stored procedures and functions. The backend also retrieves order details from the database when a user asks to track an existing order. This interaction between the chatbot and the database ensures that user data is stored and managed efficiently. The chatbot can handle real-time order modifications, such as adding or removing items from an order, and respond with confirmations or further questions. Finally, the chatbot is integrated into a responsive website built using HTML and CSS, where users can interact with it through a clean, user-friendly interface. The embedded Dialog Flow widget allows users to communicate with the chatbot directly from the website, making it an intuitive tool for ordering and tracking food in a real-time conversational manner. This architecture allows for a smooth, end-to-end flow from user input to backend processing and database management, delivering a comprehensive chatbot solution for restaurant operations.
